        Tips for creating strong passwords and passphrases</h1>
    <p class="para">
    </p>
    <p class="para">
        A password is a string of characters used to access information or a computer. 
        Passphrases are typically longer than passwords, for added security, and contain 
        multiple words that create a phrase. Passwords and passphrases help prevent 
        unauthorized people from accessing files, programs, and other resources. When 
        you create a password or passphrase, you should make it strong, which means it&#39;s 
        difficult to guess or crack. It&#39;s a good idea to use strong passwords on all 
        user accounts on your computer. If you&#39;re using a workplace network, your 
        network administrator might require you to use a strong password.</p>

                    In wireless networking, a Wi‑Fi Protected Access (WPA) security key supports the 
                    use of a passphrase. This passphrase is converted into a key that is used for 
                    encryption, which is not visible to you. For more information about WPA security 
                    keys, see <a class="navigationLink"

            A password or passphrase might meet all the criteria above and still be weak. 
            For example, <span class="newTerm">Hello2U!</span> meets all the criteria for a

            word. <span class="newTerm">H3ll0 2 U!</span> is a stronger alternative because 
            it replaces some of the letters in the complete word with numbers and also

                    birthday is 12 December, 2004</span>. Using that phrase as your guide, you might
