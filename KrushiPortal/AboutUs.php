                      said Mahatma Gandhi six decades ago. Even today, the situation is still the 
                      same, with almost the entire economy being sustained by agriculture, which is 
                      the mainstay of the villages. It contributes 16% of the overall GDP and accounts 
                      for employment of approximately 52% of the Indian population. Rapid growth in 
                      agriculture is essential not only for self-reliance but also to earn valuable 
                      foreign exchange. </span>

                      productivity despite of the fact that millions are marginal and small farmers. 
                      They adopt improved agriculture technology as efficiently as farmers in 
                      developed countries. It is felt that with provision of timely and adequate 
                      inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, pesticides and by making available affordable 
                      agricultural credit /crop insurance, Indian farmers are going to ensure food and 
                      nutritional security to the Nation. </span>

                      It is envisaged to make available relevant information and services to the 
                      farming community and private sector through the use of information and 
                      communication technologies, to supplement the existing delivery channels 
                      provided for by the department.<span class="style31"> 'FarmersLink' </span>is an endeavour in this 
                      direction to create one stop shop for meeting all informational needs relating 
                      to Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries sectors production, sale/storage 
                      of an Indian farmer. With this Indian Farmer will not be required to sift 
                      through maze of websites created for specific purposes.</p>
                  <p class="textSt">
                      Once in the <span class="style31">FarmersLink</span>, a farmer will be able to get all relevant 
                      information on specific subjects around his village/block /district or state. 
                      This information will be delivered in the form of text, SMS, email and 
                      audio/video in the language he or she understands. These levels can be easily 
                      reached through the Map of India placed on the Home page. Farmers will also be 
                      able to ask specific queries as well as give valuable feedback through the 
                      Feedback module specially developed for the purpose.
